# Marvel Heroes
Marvel Heroes is an App that accesses the Marvel character catalog and shows us the details of each of the characters.

# Requirements¬†üìã

In order to run the project it is necessary to execute "pod install" in the project directory to install the dependencies. If you do not have cocoapods installed, you can install it by following the instructions on this page: https://cocoapods.org/.

# Installation¬†üîß
Open the Marvel Heroes.xcworkspace file in Xcode for everything to work properly. Otherwise the Pod dependencies would not work.

It is necessary to add the public and private keys of the Marvel API, since for security reasons these are not included in the project.

To add the keys, you must go to current Scheme and fill the Environment Variables "MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY" and "MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY" by the corresponding keys. Keys can be obtained by registering on the page ‚Äúhttps://developer.marvel.com/".
